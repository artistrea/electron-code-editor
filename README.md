#  Code editor - My first electron app

Final product:
- A code editor with ok UX:
    - Displayable project tree
    - Visual cues for unsaved files
    - Syntax and stupid errors highlighting (closing bracket required) for HTML, CSS and JS
    - git visual cues (uncommited, new or changed, deleted, .gitignored)
    - customizeable keyboard shortcuts
    - Multiple tabs

Steps to take:
- Get a saved file, edit and save on Ctrl+s (done)
- Open project (directory) and show on sidebar (ability to choose file to edit)
- Syntax highlighting for html, js and css
- Some error linting?: closing tag required, closing brackets, etc
- UX: Folding directories, asking if wishes to save before closing/changing file

This is my first ever electron app, where I'm still discovering how to do the basic stuff. I already develop for frontend web so it's not that big of a jump, but it still feels like a big jump.

## Getting started
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
